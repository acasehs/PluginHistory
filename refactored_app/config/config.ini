reason_cannot_complete = Patching requires thorough testing and coordination with operational requirements to ensure system availability during critical mission periods.
operational_impact = Disconnecting these assets from the MCEN would significantly impact mission operations and disrupt critical business functions.
plan_of_action = 1. Coordinate with system owners to schedule maintenance window
	2. Test patches in development environment
	3. Apply patches during approved maintenance window
	4. Verify system functionality post-patching
	5. Conduct vulnerability scan to confirm remediation
timeline_milestones = Week 1: Coordinate maintenance scheduling
	Week 2-3: Test patches in development environment
	Week 4: Apply patches during maintenance window
	Week 5: Post-patch verification and vulnerability scanning
vulnerability_detection_method = Continuous vulnerability scanning using Nessus and regular compliance assessments. System monitoring through HBSS and network monitoring tools for signs of compromise.
temporary_mitigations = Network segmentation and access controls are in place. Intrusion detection systems are monitoring for suspicious activity. Patch management process ensures timely application of security updates.
